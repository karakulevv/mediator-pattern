# Mediator Pattern

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by encapsulating their interactions within a mediator object. It facilitates communication between objects without them needing to know about each other, reducing direct connections and dependencies.

## Purpose

- **Centralized Communication**: Encapsulates object interactions within a mediator, centralizing communication logic and reducing direct object connections.
  
- **Decoupling**: Promotes loose coupling by allowing objects to communicate through a mediator without having explicit knowledge of each other.

- **Simplifying Interactions**: Eliminates complex direct relationships between objects, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

## Components

### Mediator
- Acts as the central component that defines an interface for communication between various objects.
- Encapsulates the logic of how objects interact and facilitates their communication.

### Colleague Objects
- Various objects that need to communicate with each other.
- Interact indirectly through the mediator, without having direct knowledge of other objects.

## How It Works

1. **Mediator Creation**: The mediator is instantiated and shared among objects that need to communicate.
2. **Indirect Communication**: Colleague objects send messages or requests to the mediator instead of directly communicating with each other.
3. **Mediated Communication**: The mediator relays these messages or actions to other colleague objects as needed.

## Usage

- **When you have a complex system with multiple objects that need to interact indirectly.**
- **When you want to reduce dependencies between objects and avoid complex direct connections.**

## Example

This repository contains a simple example of a chatroom scenario implementing the Mediator Pattern in [programming language]. The example showcases how participants communicate through a mediator (chatroom) without having direct knowledge of each other.

For implementation details, code examples, and explanations, refer to the code snippets and explanations in the repository's code directory.

## Implementation Notes

- Ensure the mediator encapsulates the interaction logic without introducing unnecessary complexity.
- Use the Mediator Pattern when it significantly simplifies object interactions, avoiding over-engineering for simpler cases.
